# OASIS Open Projects Guiding Principles

The OASIS Open Projects program values openness, transparency, and collaboration. Our policies have been designed to encourage and promote these values across all Open Projects. 

OASIS has crafted these policies based on decades of experience collaborating on open standards, with input from leaders in Open Source and industry. We welcome your questions and input via [email](mailto:open-projects-admin@oasis-open.org) or by opening an issue on this repository.  

## Application of Policies & Rules

The policies in this directory are the "plain-speak" version of [OASIS Open Project (OP) Rules][rules], which were approved by the OASIS Board of Directors on 22 May 2018 and became effective 22 May 2018. 

They apply to all Open Projects and to the OASIS Open Projects program repositories themselves.

Changes to rules & policies must be approved by the OASIS Board of Directors and will apply to previously-established Open Projects upon their adoption (there is no 'grandfather' clause). However, OASIS may not change the terms of any signed CLA once it has been delivered to OASIS.
