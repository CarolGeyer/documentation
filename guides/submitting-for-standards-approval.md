## Submitting Work for Standards Approval

One of the many benefits of becoming an OASIS Open Projects is that your project will be eligible to submit work for formal standards consideration to OASIS and beyond. If you're considering submitting work from your Open Project for standards approval, this guide is for you. 

Work submitted for standards approval is subject to broader review and scrutiny. If you are new to standards work, these documents will help you get more familiar with OASIS's standards terminology and process:

* [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22)
* [Section 2.8 of the Technical Committee Process Document](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26#OASISstandard)
* [Interoperability Guidelines](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/interoperability-guidelines)
* [RFC 2119 Keyword Guidelines](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/keyword-guidelines)

### What can be a standard?

Almost anything your project produces could conceivably become a standard. Most commonly though, things like APIs, data formats, information exchange formats, schemas and so on are good to create standards for. 

If you're curious about whether your project work will be a good standard, the Open Project Administrator can introduce you to technical committees or other stakeholders to learn how your effort fits into the broader standards ecosystem.

### Producing an OASIS Standard

Once work in an Open Project is underway, decisions about how the work proceeds are left in the hands of the community and the PGB and TSC. Pull requests, builds, assembly of releases, etc. are all handled as the PGB or TSC sees fit. At OASIS, Work intended for standardization advances through a series of approvals: *Project Specification Draft*, *Project Specification*, *Candidate OASIS Standard*, and finally, *OASIS Standard*.

At some point in the projectâ€™s development, the community may identify work that would benefit from becoming an open standard, for example, an API or an information exchange message format. The specific set of contributions to be formally considered should be arranged in the relevant Project Repository or repositories so that the set can be accessed and referenced as a distinct branch (a Designated Branch).
The PGB should then contact the [Open Projects Administrator][email] to request a Project Specification template. This template is used to organize and package the contents for the subsequent steps. In order to be advanced through the approval process, a proposed Project Specification must conform to the template.

When this is complete, the PGB notifies project participants and the Open Projects Administrator of its intent to approve the package. Fourteen days after this notification, the PGB may approve the package as a *Project Specification Draft*. This approval can be via ballot or by motion in a meeting or by other consensus decision-making method provided the approval process and the record of it are publicly visible. 

Once the *Project Specification Draft* is approved, the PGB may act to approve it as a *Project Specification*. As above, the PGB must notify the participants and the Open Projects Administrator of its intent 14 days in advance. After the 14-day notification period, the Open Projects Administrator will conduct a [Special Majority Vote][terms] of the PGB members. This ballot will be carried out by electronic ballot. Upon its passing, the Administrator will work with the PGB to prepare the final *Project Specification*, load it to the OASIS library of approved work, and promote the approval. 

A Project Specification must satisfy each of the following requirements:

(a) Written notice of nomination must be given by the PGB to all those involved with the Project and the Open Project Administrator at least fourteen days prior to initiating a ballot. The ballot must be conducted by a [**Special Majority Vote**][terms] of the PGB. 

(b) Any machine-executable instructions in a specific computer language (code) that are included in the Project Specification must be composed only of one or more Releases or Group Releases bearing Implementer-Class Licenses.

(c) Any guidance, descriptions, processes, models for the behavior of a system or service, or other content that is not machine-executable, and is included in the Project Specification, must be composed only of contributions (which may include Releases or Group Releases) previously made to a Project Repository.

(d) The proposed Project Specification will be subject to review and confirmation of conformance by the Open Project Administrator before the approval ballot is opened.

If the PGB wishes to continue, the next step will be to collect three or more [Statements of Use][terms] (SoU) of the *Project Specification*. These are short affirmations made by an entity that has successfully used or implemented the specification in compliance with all or some of its conformance clauses. Note that implementations of all kinds are welcome (partial or complete; prototype, proof-of-concept, example, model, or reference implementations), provided that PGBs may not designate any single implementation of a Project Specification as exclusive or privileged. Once the SoUs have been collected, the Open Projects Administrator will conduct a Special Majority Vote of the PGB to approve the specification as a *Candidate OASIS Standard* (COS). 

Once approved and published, the Administrator will broadly announce a 60-day public review of the COS. The specific steps involved depend on whether or not the PGB receives comments and whether or not they choose to make changes to the specification. The steps are explained in section [2.8.2 Public Review of a Candidate OASIS Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26#OSpublicRev). In general, however, once the public review is completed, the COS will be presented to the OASIS Membership in a [Call for Consent](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26#OScallForConsent). If the Call closes with no objections raised, the COS will be published as an approved *OASIS Standard* and announced and promoted widely by OASIS. 

An approved *OASIS Standard* is available for submission to other standards organizations for their consideration. The requirements and steps involved are explained in the [Policy for submitting OASIS work to other organizations](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/liaison#submitwork) section of the OASIS Liaison Policy.
